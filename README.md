Mini Challenge
Blog Preview Card
Your challenge is to build out this blog preview card and get it looking as close to the design as possible. 
Peer Review: Alicia Bryant - Looks good overall. There needs to be some spacing between the "learning" and the "published" date. Also needs spacing above Greg at the bottom. Color for "learning" section looks a little off. Also, there needs to be some spacing between the image and the learning section. Page is responsive! Just needs some little changes. Overall, great job :)
